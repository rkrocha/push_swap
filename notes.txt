Just Google stack sorting. That's the idea of this project. Well, you're advised to spend a week or so on your own algo. After that see other solutions on internet, compare them, choose the better one and try to memorize it.

The best advices I would give you for push-swap, are:
Dont limit yourself to C use python or any other laguage that handles the memory stuff to iterate fast on the algorithm logic

Once you tested your algorithm and it meets the requirements, implement the 'backend' memory managment stuff, SEPARATELY from the 'driver' algorithm that will orchestrate your backend

Make your parser BULLET-PROOF

Also on the general subject of optimization, finding the shortest possible amount of instructions, in this case. Take a look at dynamic programming, especially Longest Increasing Subsequence, it will help you a lot

my push swap accepted ./push_swap "1 2 3 5 4" and ./push_swap 1 2 3 5 4 but not both at the same time

You can check the valid cases using ./checker_os
+) ./push_swap 3 " +000002" 6 5  has same result as ./push_swap 3 2 6 5

Oi Paulo, não entreguei ainda mas a nota mínima é 80% e vc precisa tirar 6 pontos de 10 nos testes de 100 e 500 números
"With 3 numbers, we need to sort it with not more than 3 instructions.
With 5 numbers, we need to sort it with not more than 12 instructions.
With 100 numbers, we can get
5 points if the size of the list of instructions is less than 700
4 points if the size of the list of instructions is less than 900
3 points if the size of the list of instructions is less than 1100
2 points if the size of the list of instructions is less than 1300
1 points if the size of the list of instructions is less than 1500
With 500 numbers, we can get
5 points if the size of the list of instructions is less than 5500
4 points if the size of the list of instructions is less than 7000
3 points if the size of the list of instructions is less than 8500
2 points if the size of the list of instructions is less than 10000
1 points if the size of the list of instructions is less than 11500
According to unreliable sources, we need to get at least 6 points to pass."
