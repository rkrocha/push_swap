## About The Project

C programming can be very tedious when one doesnâ€™t have access to those highly useful standard functions. This project gives you the opportunity to re-write those functions, understand them, and learn to use them. This library will help you for all your future C projects.

For more information check out this project's [PDF](https://github.com/rkrocha/42cursus/blob/master/subjects/00.libft.pdf).
